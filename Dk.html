                Dk is a character in super smash bros ultimate that gets hit very easily. He's got a big hitbox and an easy to punish recovery. He also got one of if not the worst disadvantage state of any character. To counteract this, dk has one of the best advantages, having quick follow up moves like back air,  neutral air, up air or one of his 4 spikes. If dk were to be described in one word it would be glass cannon. Incredible power but horrible defence. The purpose of this site is to show you all that dk has to offer in terms of matchups, frame-data, character specific tech and ways to help get out of disadvantage.

            <p>
                Donkey kong(dk) has a lot of character spacific words and other words that new players might not know. This part will explain all of these words so you can understand them. Most of these will be better explained later. Platform assisted knock out or pdko is a when a donkey kong grabs his aponent and throws them upwards just befor he hits a platform alowing him to jump imediatly and hit his aponents knocking them out of the stage. Sticky walk is when dk grabs his aponent and walks to the lage aiming the movment stick lightly downwards. If done corectly when the openent escapes the grab they will both move forward going of stage alowing dk to go for edge guards.
